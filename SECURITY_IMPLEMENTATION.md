# 🔐 SmartSecure Sri Lanka - Role-Based Access Control Implementation

## 🎯 Security Features Implemented

### 1. Complete Role Separation
**Admin Dashboard** (`/admin`):
- ✅ Dark theme with security-focused design
- ✅ Prominently displays threat level with visual indicators (🚨 HIGH, ⚠️ MEDIUM, ✅ LOW)
- ✅ Real-time system metrics (CPU, Memory, Disk, Network)
- ✅ Security events timeline with severity indicators
- ✅ System health overview with color-coded cards
- ✅ Admin control panels for User Management, Analytics, and System Settings
- ✅ Red warning banner: "ADMINISTRATOR MODE - Restricted Access"
- ✅ Security footer: "RESTRICTED AREA - accessible ONLY to administrators"

**User Dashboard** (`/dashboard`):
- ✅ Clean, modern interface without admin features
- ✅ Personal file management
- ✅ Basic security status (not system-wide)
- ✅ Personal analytics and insights
- ✅ NO access to system metrics
- ✅ NO access to user management
- ✅ NO access to admin controls

### 2. Multi-Layer Security Implementation

#### Frontend Protection (React)
```javascript
// Layer 1: Route Guards
AdminRoute component checks:
  - If user is logged in
  - If user.role === 'admin'
  - Redirects non-admins to /dashboard
  - Logs all access attempts

// Layer 2: Page-Level Checks
AdminDashboard.jsx:
  - useEffect checks user.role on mount
  - Redirects if not admin
  - Prevents rendering of admin content

DashboardPage.jsx:
  - useEffect checks if user.role === 'admin'
  - Redirects admins to /admin
  - Prevents admins from seeing user dashboard

// Layer 3: Context-Level Role Management
AuthContext stores:
  - user.id
  - user.username
  - user.email
  - user.role ← KEY FIELD
  - user.token
```

#### Backend Protection (Flask)
```python
# Layer 1: JWT Token Verification
verify_token() checks:
  - Token validity
  - Token expiration
  - Returns user_data with role

# Layer 2: Admin Endpoint Protection
All /admin/* endpoints:
  1. Verify JWT token
  2. Check if user_data.get('role') != 'admin'
  3. Log security alert if non-admin attempts access
  4. Return 403 Forbidden
  5. Only proceed if admin verified

Protected Admin Endpoints:
  - /admin/stats
  - /admin/analytics
  - /admin/audit-logs
  - /admin/security-alerts

# Layer 3: Login Response
/login endpoint returns:
  - JWT token with role embedded
  - User object with role field
  - Role determines redirect destination
```

### 3. Login Flow with Role-Based Redirect

**Step-by-Step Process:**

1. **User enters credentials** → LoginForm.jsx / Login.jsx
   
2. **Backend authenticates** → `/login` endpoint
   - Verifies username/password
   - Retrieves user role from database
   - Creates JWT token with role
   - Returns: `{ success: true, token, user: { id, username, email, role } }`

3. **Frontend receives response** → Login.jsx
   ```javascript
   if (result.user.role === 'admin') {
     navigate('/admin');  // Admin Dashboard
   } else {
     navigate('/dashboard');  // User Dashboard
   }
   ```

4. **Role stored in multiple locations:**
   - localStorage: `user` object with role
   - AuthContext: user state with role
   - JWT token: embedded role claim

5. **Every page load checks role:**
   - AdminDashboard: Requires role === 'admin'
   - DashboardPage: Blocks if role === 'admin'

### 4. Security Monitoring & Logging

**Frontend Console Logs:**
```
✅ Admin access granted for user: admin
⚠️ Unauthorized access attempt - User pamith (role: user) tried to access admin area
```

**Backend Server Logs:**
```
✅ Admin access granted: admin accessing admin stats
⚠️ SECURITY ALERT: User 'pamith' (role: user) attempted to access admin stats endpoint
⚠️ SECURITY ALERT: User 'pamith' (role: user) attempted to access admin audit-logs endpoint
⚠️ SECURITY ALERT: User 'pamith' (role: user) attempted to access admin security-alerts endpoint
```

### 5. Visual Security Indicators

**Admin Dashboard:**
- 🔴 Red/Orange header bar: "ADMINISTRATOR MODE"
- 🚨 Large threat level indicator with animation (if HIGH)
- 🔴 Red "LIVE" indicator on Real-time System Metrics
- ⚠️ Red warning footer about restricted access
- Dark theme (slate-900/purple-900) for visual distinction

**User Dashboard:**
- Clean white/gray theme
- Blue accents (welcoming, non-threatening)
- Personal focus (no system-wide data)
- Friendly language

### 6. Security Events Timeline

**Admin Dashboard displays:**
- ✅ Info events (system startup, user login)
- ⚠️ Warning events (high upload activity)
- 🚨 Critical events (security threats)
- Timeline format with severity colors:
  - Critical: Red border, red background
  - Warning: Yellow border, yellow background
  - Info: Green border, green background

### 7. Testing Security

**Test Admin Access:**
```bash
1. Login as: admin / admin123
2. Should redirect to: /admin
3. Should see: Dark dashboard with system metrics
4. Should NOT be able to access: /dashboard (redirects to /admin)
```

**Test User Access:**
```bash
1. Login as: pamith / admin123
2. Should redirect to: /dashboard
3. Should see: Clean white dashboard
4. Should NOT be able to access: /admin (redirects to /dashboard, logs security alert)
5. Backend logs: "⚠️ SECURITY ALERT: User 'pamith' attempted to access admin..."
```

**Test Direct URL Access:**
```bash
1. Login as regular user (pamith)
2. Try to navigate to: http://localhost:5173/admin
3. Result: Immediately redirected to /dashboard
4. Console: "⚠️ Unauthorized access attempt"
```

## 🔒 Security Best Practices Implemented

✅ **Principle of Least Privilege**: Users only see data they're authorized for
✅ **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security checks
✅ **Secure by Default**: All admin endpoints require explicit admin role
✅ **Fail Secure**: Unauthorized access attempts redirect, don't show error pages
✅ **Audit Logging**: All access attempts logged for security monitoring
✅ **Clear Visual Distinction**: Admin and user interfaces visually different
✅ **Role Embedded in Token**: Can't be tampered with client-side
✅ **Server-Side Validation**: Every admin endpoint verifies role on backend

## 🚀 How to Test

1. **Start servers:**
   ```bash
   Backend: cd backend; $env:PYTHONIOENCODING='utf-8'; python final_working_server.py
   Frontend: cd frontend; npm run dev
   ```

2. **Test Admin:**
   - Login: admin / admin123
   - Expect: Dark dashboard at /admin
   - Try: Navigate to /dashboard → Should redirect back to /admin

3. **Test User:**
   - Logout, Login: pamith / admin123
   - Expect: White dashboard at /dashboard
   - Try: Navigate to /admin → Should redirect to /dashboard
   - Check backend logs: Should see security alerts

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **Clear Browser Cache/Tokens:**
   - If experiencing issues, clear localStorage:
   ```javascript
   localStorage.clear();
   ```
   - Then login again

2. **Role Changes:**
   - Role is set during login
   - To change user role, must logout and login again
   - Role is stored in JWT token (can't be changed client-side)

3. **Security Monitoring:**
   - Check backend terminal for security alerts
   - All unauthorized access attempts are logged
   - Admin access is also logged for audit trail

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

**Admin Dashboard:**
- **Color**: Dark (slate/purple) - Professional, serious
- **Indicators**: Red/Orange/Green - Clear severity levels
- **Animations**: Pulsing alerts for HIGH threats
- **Layout**: Dense information, metrics-focused
- **Tone**: Security-focused, authoritative

**User Dashboard:**
- **Color**: Light (white/gray/blue) - Welcoming, friendly
- **Indicators**: Positive reinforcement (green checks)
- **Animations**: Smooth transitions, non-alarming
- **Layout**: Spacious, easy to navigate
- **Tone**: User-friendly, helpful

**Security Status: 🔒 SECURED**

All role-based access controls are implemented and tested. The system now provides complete separation between admin and user access with multiple layers of security verification.
