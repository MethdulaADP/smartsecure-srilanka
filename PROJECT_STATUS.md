## 🔧 RECENT CRITICAL FIXES (October 8-9, 2025)

### **Issue #1: Token Authentication Error** ✅ RESOLVED
**Problem:**
- Frontend was looking for token as `localStorage.getItem('token')`
- AuthService was storing it as `localStorage.getItem('smartsecure_token')`
- Caused "Token verification error: Not enough segments"

**Impact:**
- All API calls failing with 401 Unauthorized
- File uploads not working
- Admin dashboard showing zero data
- User dashboard not loading files

**Solution:**
- Updated all components to use `'smartsecure_token'`:
  - AdminDashboard.jsx (2 instances)
  - UserDashboard.jsx (1 instance)
  - FilesPage.jsx (3 instances)
  - SecurityPage.jsx (2 instances)

**Result:** ✅ All API calls now working, file uploads functional, dashboards show real data

### **Issue #2: Stale Token in AuthService** ✅ RESOLVED
**Problem:**
- Singleton pattern causing stale token in memory
- Token wasn't updating after login

**Solution:**
- Modified `getAuthHeaders()` to read fresh token from localStorage
- Modified `isAuthenticated()` to refresh token and user data
- Modified `getCurrentUser()` to return fresh user
- Modified `getToken()` to return fresh token
- Modified `uploadFile()` to use fresh token

**Result:** ✅ Token always fresh, seamless authentication across page reloads

### **Issue #3: UI Navigation Structure** ✅ IMPLEMENTED
**Implementation:**
- Created `AuthenticatedLayout.jsx` for logged-in users
- Main navigation: Dashboard 📊 | Files 📁 | Security 🔒
- Quick Access corner: Home, Services, About, Contact
- UserDashboard shows ONLY personal data (no system-wide stats)
- AdminDashboard completely isolated (no public page access)

**Result:** ✅ Clear separation between admin and user interfaces
