# Supervisor Meeting Q&A Preparation
## SmartSecure Sri Lanka - Expected Questions & Answers

**Date:** October 9, 2025  
**Purpose:** Prepare for supervisor questions and approval meeting

---

## SECTION 1: PROJECT CONCEPT & MOTIVATION

### Q1: Why did you choose this project?
**Answer:**
"I chose this project because I observed that small businesses in Sri Lanka struggle with file security. Many SMEs use basic solutions like Google Drive or Dropbox, but they lack:
- Customized security for sensitive business data
- Affordable local solutions
- AI-powered threat detection
- Compliance with local data protection needs

I wanted to create something practical that solves a real problem for our local business community."

### Q2: What makes your project unique/different from existing solutions?
**Answer:**
"Three key differentiators:
1. **Local Focus:** Designed specifically for Sri Lankan SMEs with their budget constraints
2. **AI Threat Detection:** Built-in automated security scanning - not common in affordable solutions
3. **Self-Hostable:** Businesses can host it themselves, avoiding monthly subscription fees
4. **Simplicity:** Non-technical users can operate it easily

Unlike Dropbox or Google Drive, this gives businesses full control over their data with enterprise-level security features."

### Q3: Who is your target audience?
**Answer:**
"Primary target: Small businesses with 5-50 employees in Sri Lanka who:
- Handle sensitive documents (financial records, customer data)
- Need secure file sharing within the team
- Can't afford enterprise solutions like Microsoft SharePoint
- Want data stored locally for compliance reasons

Secondary target: Startups and entrepreneurs transitioning from paper-based systems to digital."

## SECTION 2: TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION

### Q4: What technologies are you using and why?
**Answer:**
"**Frontend:**
- React.js - Industry-standard, component-based UI framework
- Vite - Fast development and build tool
- Tailwind CSS - Rapid responsive design

**Backend:**
- Python Flask - Lightweight, flexible, perfect for RESTful APIs
- SQLite - Serverless database, easy deployment, sufficient for SMEs
- JWT - Stateless authentication, scalable

**Why these?**
- Free and open-source
- Good documentation
- Easy to deploy
- Proven security track record"

### Q5: Explain your system architecture
**Answer:**
"It's a **client-server architecture with REST API:**

**Frontend (React)** runs on port 5173:
- User interface and interactions
- Sends HTTP requests to backend
- Stores JWT token for authentication

**Backend (Flask)** runs on port 5004:
- Handles all business logic
- Processes file uploads/downloads
- Runs AI threat detection
- Manages authentication

**Database (SQLite)**:
- Stores users, files metadata, audit logs
- File data stored on filesystem for performance

They communicate via JSON over HTTP with JWT authentication on every request."

### Q6: How does your AI threat detection work?
**Answer:**
"It's a **multi-factor threat scoring system:**

1. **File Extension Analysis** - Detects executables (.exe, .bat, .scr) = High risk
2. **File Size Analysis** - Files >50MB flagged = Suspicious
3. **Archive Detection** - Compressed files (.zip, .rar) = Medium risk  
4. **Content Pattern Analysis** - Randomized simulation of content inspection

Each factor contributes to a **threat score (0.0 to 1.0)**:
- Score > 0.7 = HIGH risk (blocked or warned)
- Score 0.4-0.7 = MEDIUM risk (needs review)
- Score < 0.4 = LOW risk (safe)

The system updates the database with scan results and displays them to users."

### Q7: How do you ensure security?
**Answer:**
"**12 Security Layers:**

1. **JWT Authentication** - HS256 signed tokens, 24-hour expiration
2. **bcrypt Password Hashing** - Industry standard, automatic salting
3. **SQL Injection Protection** - Parameterized queries everywhere
4. **XSS Prevention** - Input sanitization and escaping
5. **CSRF Protection** - Token validation on state-changing operations
6. **File Encryption** - Secure storage with encrypted filenames
7. **UUID File Naming** - Prevents path traversal attacks
8. **MD5 Checksums** - File integrity verification
9. **Role-Based Access Control** - Admin vs User permissions
10. **CORS Whitelist** - Only approved origins can make requests
11. **AI Threat Scanning** - Automatic malicious file detection
12. **Audit Logging** - Track all security events

I've followed **OWASP Top 10** guidelines throughout development."
